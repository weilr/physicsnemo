"""
Physicsnemo layernorm module makes a decision, at import time, on whether or not
to use transformer engine.  It can be overridden by setting the
PHYSICSNEMO_FORCE_TE environment variable.

But, transformer engine is not available on CPU, so we need to cleanup the
module after the tests are run.

This fixture runs automatically before every test in the models directory.
It deletes the layer_norm module from sys.modules, which forces a fresh import
of the module at each test.
