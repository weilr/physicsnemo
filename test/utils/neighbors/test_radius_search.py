    We use two utilities for this.

    There is a default pytorch implementation, which uses a brute force computation
    at significant expense of memory and computation.

    There is a warp backended implementation which uses hash maps and
    a better algorithm.

    the test here is to enforce agreement between the two utilities.
    There is no reason to directly test the results: the algorithm
